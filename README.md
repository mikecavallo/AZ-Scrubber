# AZ Scrubber
 This Python CLI program scrubs stale inventory per user input
This program is free to use from git but if implemented in any other software, pleaase contact me.

AZ Scrubber is a simple CLI program that parses your active inventory .CSV file which can be downloaded from your FBA inventory dashboard.
I left it up to the user to input the parameters for removal and even added an extra feature where you can add a price for which books that would of been disposed of could be send home to sell for merchant fulfillent. 
The timeframes on items to remove under your rank threshold were provided by Amazon, not me. If it was up to me I would of had user input a hard number for days.

This is my first Python program written in about 7 years, so I appreciate any feedback good or bad.

The program will output 2 files, one for removals that met your criteria and the returns, which were items over your rannk threshold and also over your price threshold in case you wanted to sell merchant fulfilment.

I am open or feature requeat at mikecavallo@gmail.com
